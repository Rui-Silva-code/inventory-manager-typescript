## 🚧 TypeScript Migration (In Progress/Learning)

This repository is being progressively migrated from JavaScript to TypeScript
as a learning-focused exercise.

# 📦 Inventory Manager

> A full-stack **learning project** built with React, Node.js, and PostgreSQL, focused on exploring real-world inventory management patterns such as authentication, role-based access control, audit logging, and Excel-like data interaction.  
>  
> Developed as a hands-on project with the assistance of AI, prioritizing clarity, stability, and learning over production readiness.

## 🧪 Project Purpose

This application was created as a **learning-focused project**, with the aspiration to be a finished commercial product.
Also inspired by a former company I used to work for.

The goal is to experiment with:
- Full-stack architecture
- Enterprise-style UX patterns
- Data safety and traceability
- Role-based authorization
- Iterative development with AI assistance

The project intentionally favors **predictable behavior and clarity** over premature optimization.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Roles
- Secure login using JWT
- Role-based access control:
  - **Viewer** – read-only access
  - **Editor** – create, edit, mark products
  - **Admin** – full access (users, audit logs)

---

### 📊 Product Management
- Excel-like product table:
  - Sticky headers
  - Sortable columns
  - User-resizable columns
  - Auto-size on double click
  - Inline editing without layout shifts
  - Checkbox-based *Marked* state with row highlighting
- Computed **Resume** column  
  _(Reference + Color + Dimensions → e.g. Atenas Beige 112x250cm)_
- Pagination (100 rows per page)

---

### 🔎 Advanced Filtering
- Case-insensitive filters:
  - Reference
  - Color
  - Finish (Acab)
  - Rack
- Numeric filtering for X / Y dimensions
- “Marked only” toggle
- Instant client-side updates

---

### 📥 CSV Import / Export
- Safe CSV import with:
  - Header normalization
  - Invalid value protection
  - Integer sanitization
- CSV export for reporting and backups
- Designed to handle large datasets

---

### 🧾 Audit Log
- Tracks **CREATE / UPDATE / DELETE** actions
- Full before/after state comparison
- Full-row visual distinction:
  - 🟢 CREATE
  - 🟡 UPDATE
  - 🔴 DELETE
- Progressive date filtering:
  - `1` → all logs from day 1
  - `1-1` → January 1st (all years)
  - `01-01-2024` → exact date

---

### 👥 User Management (Admin)
- Create users
- Change roles with confirmation
- Prevent deletion of:
  - Your own account
  - The last remaining admin
- Visual role indicators
- Clean admin-style layout

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

### AI Assistance Disclaimer

This project was developed with the assistance of AI as a learning tool.

AI was used to:

- Explore architectural decisions
- Refactor and reason about code
- Improve UX consistency
- Validate edge cases

All implementation choices and iterations were human-driven.

---

### 📈 Future Implementation / Features

- Bulk actions:
  - Delete all marked products at once
  - Mark / unmark multiple products
- Extended Audit Log filtering:
  - Filter by user email
  - Filter by action type
- Improved authentication error handling:
  - Handle additional HTTP errors (404, 500)
  - User-friendly error messages
- Filter marked products by date
- Persist UI state:
  - Column widths per user
  - Active filters between sessions

---

### 🎓 Future Learning Goals

- Server-side pagination for large datasets
- Centralized backend error handling
- Soft deletes instead of hard deletes
- Basic automated testing (backend)
- Running the app on a local network
- Deployment experiments:
  - Production build
  - Environment configuration
  - Reverse proxy setup

---

  ### 🏢 Multi-User / Multi-Tenant Considerations

Currently, the application supports **multiple users with role-based access** within a single shared dataset.

A future goal is to evolve the system into a **multi-tenant architecture**, where:

- Each company has its own isolated inventory
- Users belong to a specific organization
- Admins manage users only within their company
- Audit logs are scoped per tenant

This would require changes in:
- Database schema (tenant/company separation)
- Authorization middleware
- Query scoping and data isolation
- UI context awareness (active company)

---

### 🎓 Future Learning Goals

- Designing multi-tenant database schemas
- Implementing tenant-based authorization
- Preventing cross-tenant data leakage
- Evaluating different isolation strategies:
  - Shared database with tenant IDs
  - Schema-per-tenant
  - Database-per-tenant
